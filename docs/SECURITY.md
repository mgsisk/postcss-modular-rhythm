# Security

Project maintainers encourage contributions from external security researchers.

## Disclosure

Report security issues for this project to [security@mgsisk.com][] with this
project's name in the subject line. Project maintainers will make every effort
to acknowledge, review, and address security issues as soon as possible.
Reporters will receive progress updates, and should work with project
maintainers as much as they are able to help address reported issues.

This project recommends responsible disclosure for security issues. Project
maintainers may suggest a public disclosure embargo and resolution timeline
to reporters based on issue severity and estimated time to resolve. Reporters
should cooperate with project maintainers and work privately with them to
address issues during such an embargo.

any outstanding security issues that have been publicly disclosed. Project
maintainers may publicly disclose security issues through other channels, and
will work with reporters to determine an appropriate public response.

other versions are out of scope. Report security issues in third-party projects
to the individual(s) responsible for maintaining those projects.
